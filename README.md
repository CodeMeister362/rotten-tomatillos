## Context ðŸŽ¬

Rotten Tomatillos was a partnered project build during Nate and Em's third semester enrolled in [Turing School of Software & Design's Front End Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The project was built to match the specifications of our [project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html), and represents our first finished React Application. In addition to challenging us to tackle brand-new React syntax, conventions, and architecture, Rotten Tomatillos also required us to incorporate the following languages, technologies, and competencies: 
  * Test-Driven Development utilizing the Cypress framework
  * URL customization and browser compatibility via Router 
  * Object-Oriented Programming
  * Network requests & API data 
  * Git workflow
  * [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/CodeMeister362/projects/3/views/1)

## Goals and Challenges ðŸŽ¬
As mentioned, Rotten Tomatillos was our first full-scale React application, so utilizing this brand-new framework was both challenging and rewarding-- learning to translate our understanding of traditional JavaScript holistic architecture to React's component-based architecture required a perspective shift that was often frustrating and required a lot of self-teaching, exploration, and observant trial-and-error. 

We utilized Cypress to test this application, which was also new to us as of this project. While navigating Cypress was also a learning experience, we found that the visualization and the end-to-end scope of Cypress fairly intuitive. Still, learning this new syntax and correctly applying it to test both happy and sad user paths required quite a bit of independent study. 

Our biggest challenge and proudest achievement throughout the Rotten Tomatillos project was utilizing Router to generate unique URLs for different application page views and to take advantage of built-in browser navigation tools. While this may seem like a relatively small detail, these functionalities have a big impact, and they also represent the result of time spent pouring over Router documentation, many YouTube videos watched, study of countless Stack Overflow solutions, and lots and lots of enthusiastic teamwork between Nate, Em, and members of our Turing 2301 Cohort. 

## Future Development Opportunities ðŸŽ¬
Due to time constraints, we opted to keep Rotten Tomatillos relatively simple but extremely solid in architecture, testing, and usability. Given additional time for development, we'd love to set up a back-end server that allows users to log in, save movies to a watch list, and submit user ratings for each movie in the database.
